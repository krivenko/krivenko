## Hey there!

I am a postdoctoral researcher currently working at the I. Institute of
Theoretical Physics, University of Hamburg, Germany.

I like to design and implement novel algorithms (including massively parallel
algorithms) for numerical simulation of condensed matter systems, and of quantum
systems in general.

My programming languages of choice are [C++](https://isocpp.org/),
[Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Julia](https://julialang.org/).
Some of the other technologies I find useful in my work are
[Wolfram Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/),
UNIX shell scripting, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/),
[Apptainer/Singularity](https://apptainer.org/), [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
and LaTeX.
